Arduino-AVRISPmkII-workaround
==========

A **workaround** for [Arduino/#2986](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/issues/2986). Some people are getting the error message: `avrdude: usbdev_open(): did not find any USB device "usb"` when trying to **Burn Bootloader** using the **AVRISP mkII** programmer under [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) IDE 1.6.x. The problem is that the two avrdude commands are sent without enough delay between them.

This **workaround** adds an **AVRISP mkII Burn Bootloader** option to **Tools>Programmer**. This programmer option causes the **erase** and **bootloader** steps to be done in the first avrdude command so burning the bootloader is accomplished successfully even though the second avrdude command fails.

#### Comparison With Alternative **Workaround**
Another **workaround** has been presented in the Arduino Forum by dmjlambert: http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=345838 here is a comparison of Arduino-AVRISPmkII-workaround vs the dmjlambert **workaround**:
##### Pros
- Doesn't require modification of any Arduino or other hardware core files
- Doesn't need to be redone every time the Arduino IDE or any hardware core with a platform.txt is updated
- Doesn't affect any programmer except for AVRISP mkII

##### Cons
- Burn Bootloader appears to fail even when successful


#### Installation
There are two options for installing Arduino-AVRISPmkII-workaround
##### Boards Manager
This installation method requires Arduino IDE version 1.6.4 or greater.
- Open the Arduino IDE.
- Open the **File > Preferences** menu item.
- Enter the following URL in **Additional Boards Manager URLs**: https://per1234.github.io/Arduino-AVRISPmkII-fix/package_per1234_Arduino-AVRISPmkII-fix_index.json
- Open the **Tools > Board > Boards Manager...** menu item.
- Wait for the platform indexes to finish downloading.
- Scroll down until you see the **Arduino-AVRISPmkII-workaround** entry and click on it.
- Click Install.
- After installation is complete close the Boards Manager window.
- If using Arduino IDE previous to v1.6.6 you may need to restart the IDE to make the **AVRISP mkII(workaround)** programmer appear in the **Tools>Programmer** menu.

##### Manual Installation
- Download the Arduino-AVRISPmkII-workaround files here: https://github.com/per1234/Arduino-AVRISPmkII-fix/archive/master.zip
- Extract the .zip file
- Copy the extracted folder inside your sketchbook/hardware folder.
- If the Arduino IDE is running then restart it.


#### Usage
##### Burn Bootloader
- Connect the AVRISP mkII to your Arduino
- Select **Tools>Programmer>AVRISP mkII(workaround)**
- Select the correct board from **Tools>Board**
- Click **Tools>Burn Bootloader**
- The bootloader will be burned to your Arduino but then the avrdude output will fail with the error message `avrdude: usbdev_open(): did not find any USB device "usb"`. This is because the second avrdude command failed as it will do with **Tools>Programmer>AVRISP mkII**, however if you examine the avrdude output fully you will see that the first command was successful and the bootloader was burned in that command.
